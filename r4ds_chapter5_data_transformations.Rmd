## 5.1 Introduction

### 5.1.1 Prerequisites

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

### 5.1.2 nycflights13

```{r}
flights
```

Tibbles are data frames, tweaked to work better in the `tidyverse.` To view the entire dataset: use `View(flights)`.

#### Data types:

-   `int` integers
-   `dbl` doubles, or real numbers
-   `chr` character vectors, or strings
-   `dttm` date-times
-   `lgl` logical
-   `fctr` factors, categorical variables with fixed values
-   `date` dates

### 5.1.3 dyplr basics

#### Key dyplr functions:

-   `filter()` pick observations by their values
-   `arrange()` reorder rows
-   `select()` pick variables by their names
-   `mutate()` create new variables with functions of existing variables
-   `summarise()` collapse many values down\
    First argument is always the dataframe

## 5.2 filter()

Filter flights on January 1st:

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day ==1)
```

To save the result, use the assignment operator `<-`

```{r}
jan1 <-  filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

### 5.2.1 Comparisons

Use `near()` instead of `==` when comparing floating point numbers.

```{r}
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
near(sqrt(2) ^ 2, 2)
```

### 5.2.2 Logical operators

-   `&` "and"
-   `|` "or"
-   `!` "not" !

![Complete set of boolean operators](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/01f4b6d39d2be8269740a3ad7946faa79f7243cf/8369a/diagrams/transform-logical.png)

```{r, eval = 2}
filter(flights, month == 1 | month == 12)
filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```

`%in%` is short-hand since you cannot use `month == (11|12)`. You can also make them explicit variables, e.g. `x` and `y`.

#### De Morgan's laws:  
- `!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y`
- `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`

### 5.2.3 Missing values

`NA` stands for "not availables" and represent unknown/missing values. Any operation with an unknown value will also be unknown.  
`is.na()` is used to determine if a value is missing.  
`filter()` excludes `NA` values. To preserve missing values, ask for it explicitly.
```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)

filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)

```
## 5.3 Arrange rows with arrange()

### 5.3.1  

`arrange()` arranges columns in ascending order by default. Additional column names are used to break ties in values in preceding columns.
```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```
`desc()` arranges in descending order. Missing values are always sorted at the end.
```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```

## 5.4 Select columns with select()

`select(flights, year, month, day)`  
`select(flights, year:day)`  
```{r}
select(flights, -(dep_time:time_hour))
```
These all result in the same tables.  

There are a number of helper functions you can use within select():  
* `starts_with("abc")`
* `ends_with("xyz"`)
* `contains("ijk")`
* `matches("(.)\\1")`: regular expressions
* `num_range("x", 1:3)`: `x1`, `x2`, `x3`  

You can rename variables with `rename()`. Be careful of `new_name = old_name` syntax
```{r}
(renamed_flights <- dplyr::rename(flights, Y = year, M = month, D = day))
```

A neat trick is to use select() with everything() helper to move variables to the start of the data frame.
```{r}
select(flights, time_hour, air_time, everything())
```
## 5.4 Add new variables with `mutate()`

* `mutate()` adds new columns to the end that are functions of existing columns

```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time
  )

mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)

```
* `transmute()` works the same but only selects new columns.

### 5.5.1 Useful creation functions

* Arithmatic operators: `+`, `-`, `/`, `^`
* Modular arithmetic: `%/%`, `%%`
* Logs: `log()`, `log2()`, `log10()`
* Offsets: `lead()`, `lag()`
* Cumulative and rolling aggregates: `cumsum()`, `cumprod()`, `cummin()`, `cummax()`
* Logical comparisons: `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `==`
* Ranking: `min_rank()`, `min_rank(desc())`

## 5.6 Grouped summaries with `summarise()`

> `summarise()` collapses a data frame into a single row.
> `group_by()` changes unit of analysis from complete dataset to individual groups

```{r}
group_by(iris, Species) %>% 
  summarise(irismean = mean(Sepal.Length))
```

### 5.6.1 Combining multiple operations with the pipe `%>%`

> The `%>%` improves readability of code left to right, top to bottom. It can be thought of as 'then'. Shortcut: CTRL + SHIFT + M

```{r}
delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
### 5.6.2 Missing values

> The `na.rm` argument in aggregation functions removes missing values. Inputting missing values into aggregation functions will output missing values.

```{r}
# Let's remove cancelled flights
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(mean(dep_delay))
```
### 5.6.3 Counts `n()`

> Whenever you do any aggregation, itâ€™s always a good idea to include either a count (`n()`), or a count of non-missing values (`sum(!is.na(x))`).

From the previous example: 

```{r}
flights %>%  # declare the data frame
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay)) %>%  # filter out missing values
  group_by(month) %>% # group by month
  summarise(n_months = n(), sum_month = sum(month), delay_mean =  mean(dep_delay))
```
### 5.6.4 Useful summary functions

- Measures of location: `mean(x)`, `median(x)`
- Measures of spread: `sd(x)`, `TQR(x)`, `mad(x)`
- Measures of rank: `min(x)`, `quantile(x, 0.25)`, `max(x)`
- Measures of position: `first(x)`, `nth(x, 2)`, `last(x)`
- Counts: `n()`, `sum(!is.na(x))`, `n_distinct(x)`
- Counts and proportions of logical values: `sum(x > 10)` gives number of TRUEs in x, `mean(y == 0)` gives the proportion

### 5.6.5 Grouping by multiple variables

Make it easier to progressively roll up a dataset by grouping by multiple variables.
```{r}
daily <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)

(per_day <- summarise(daily, flights = n()))
(per_month <- summarise(per_day, flights = sum(flights)))
(per_year <- summarise(per_month, flights = sum(flights)))
```
### 5.6.6 Ungrouping

```{r}
(daily_ungrouped <- daily %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarise(flights = n()))
```


## 5.7 Grouped mutates (and filters)

###

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  filter(n() > 10000)
```
